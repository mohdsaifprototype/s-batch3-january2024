  Subject: Request for On-Duty application for two days

Respected Sir,

I am Mithuna M, a student of Class X C. I have been selected

the M A Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk. I require an attested
on-duty application to be able to represent the school and
participate in the competitions. I request you to kindly
provide me with a bonafide certificate and an on-duty

Thanking you
Yours sincerely,
